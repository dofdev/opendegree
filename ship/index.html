  <pre>
A FINITE DIRECTION and an orbiting loop (logic is circular) *make blender animated gif for this concept
a layered system of attack maximize what your brain's engineering can do
build out in both directions, self discovered and actualized, seeking out flaws in your concepts
a direction is the delta between two vectors, accuracy and impact only increases with the density and breadth of layers

*FINITE but growing due to biological limits (tools can expand these, compression and storage)

loop(
  THEÂ SYSTEM
  1. catch an idea
  I see it as collapsed~condensational ! lightning, when it strikes it leaves a mark that you can recall(encoded) 
  by experiencing friction(stepping outside yourself ~deeper waters) through your unique being
  2. 

  THE SETUP
  a setup for realizing YOUR ideas that you love
  a setup is an ever evolving set of tools and skillsbuilt around realizing your ideas
)



// THE FAT
Coding is the art of encoding logically (written in the paper paradigm age)

engineering loop is something like idea nurturing~ something more organic careful loving open
not cold calculated and market perception driven
